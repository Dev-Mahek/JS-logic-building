# 🧠 JS Logic Building

Welcome to **JS Logic Building** — a collection of JavaScript exercises, challenges, and pattern-based problems designed to strengthen your **logic, loops, and problem-solving skills** in JavaScript.

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to improving **core JavaScript logic** through small, focused programs.  
Each file or folder contains examples, from **basic loops** to **pattern printing**, **conditional logic**, and **function-based problems**.

The goal is to **think like a programmer** — not just learn syntax.
